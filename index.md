## About Me
Hello, and welcome, I’m Libbie Haglin. On this site, you can learn about my areas of expertise, understand how I "do" science, and explore some personal projects I'm working on. I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I studied nm-scale membrane protein assemblies and mechanisms of signal transduction. In the 8 years I’ve spent doing biochemistry research, I have developed a passion for the diverse ways in which proteins function and a fascination by the impact that small structural changes can have on cellular homeostasis. 

I’d be delighted to connect with you, so please don’t hesitate to reach out! You can [email me](ehaglin@gmail.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-haglin/). 


## Areas of Expertise
[Click here to download my résumé.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4olu3sqwuari7xj/Haglin-Resume.pdf?dl=0)

Broadly speaking, my primary experience and interests are in:
- Protein biochemistry and biophysics
- Structural biology
- Molecular biology
- Membrane biophysics and membrane protein dynamics
- Signal transduction and bacterial chemotaxis
- Experimental design, method development, and data analysis
- Organization of data and results
- Technical writing (including scientific publications and grant applications), presentation, and communication
- Teaching, mentoring, and supervising 
- Project and team management
- Rigorously maintaining an efficient and productive laboratory space

My PhD research focused on transmembrane signaling mechanisms using a model bacterial system. Most motile bacteria use a protein system made up of a transmembrane receptor, a kinase, and a scaffold protein to relay chemical signals from their environment to change their swimming patterns. This process of chemotaxis is controlled through the global response of thousands of these proteins that assemble within the inner cellular membrane in a network of arrays that cover, on average, 53,000 nm<sup>2</sup> in surface area. Integrating both biophysical and biochemical methods, I was interested in the impact of the protein assembly architecture on function. 

My most successful work came about serendipitously: I was experimenting with loading a metal-chelating lipid with various divalent metals other than the traditional Nickel. As a control, I added the metal chlorides to our protein mixture to check for adverse effects such as aggregation. It turns out, not only did the metals cause aggregation, it was functional. Building on this phenomenon, I developed a new tool to trigger the assembly of our *in vitro* arrays that retains normal functional while mimicking the native architecture (confirmed by Cryo Electron Microscopy and SEC-MALS). Most importantly, it gave me the control of time, which allowed me to confirm a link between the size of the protein array and ability to transmit a signal. My paper describing this work was featured on the cover of *Biochemistry*, along with the artwork I created to visualize the assembly process.  


## How I "Do" Science
### Research Philosophy
In my own work, I approach problems methodically and analytically. I prefer combining tools and techniques to tackle problems from multiple angles. In the teams I've worked with, I bring a critical perspective deeply rooted in the belief that broad and sufficient data is essential to make conclusions. I also believe that visual interpretation of data can be extremely misleading, and it is the responsibility of scientists to critically evaluate and present data with integrity.

### Laboratory Philosophy
I believe in maximizing efficiency in the laboratory. This includes everything from maintaining a clean and organized lab space to carefully planning experiments and controls to avoid unnecessary repeats. I have excellent recall for past data and results because of an ingrained habit of meticulous note-taking and diligent data analysis. At any given time, I know if and exactly when I did an experiment and how to find the results.


## Personal Projects
### Dairy-Free Foods
My childhood lactose intolerance came back with a vengeance a few years ago and I have removed all dairy from my diet. Consequently, I've become passionate about learning to find or make alternatives to milk, yogurt, and cheese. The latter is the most challenging, but I've recently been experimenting with making my own plant-based "cheeze" since most commercially available options taste like chalk. A macadamia nut-based mozzarella for pizza was my most recent success. It's solidified with agar and browns just like the real thing. 

### Fitness
In recent years I've done a deep dive into strength and hypertrophy training. My fitness regiment has been curated over the years through researching proper technique and effecting training methods. I enjoy planning new sets and incorporating progressive overload techniques to keep my muscles challenged. 

Outside of the gym, I am an avid walker. I love exploring the seemingly endless number of parks near where I live, especially those along Lake Washington. 

### Reading
After realizing I read over 30 books last year, I decided to challenge myself in 2019 to make my way through 50. I predominantly enjoy science fiction and fantasy novels. If you'd like to keep up with my count, I track my progress via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5142316-libbie).

### Dungeons and Dragons
I started playing during grad school to make some friends outside of lab. Now that I'm in Seattle, I've been campaigning with new friends at [Mox Boarding House](https://www.moxboardinghouse.com/) and it's a blast! I love the way it challenges the players to think creatively when put into difficult scenarios. I'm currently playing a centaur-riding and dual-saber wielding Valkyrie named Kára Skjótsverd, but I'm partial to sorcerers and shapeshifting druids.
